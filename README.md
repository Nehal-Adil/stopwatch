# Stopwatch

This a simple project made using HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
It's a Stopwatch that you can use to record anything like a lap time, or study session, or use it in other ways. 


## Installation

I've made this project using Vanilla JavaScript, so there is no need to download any packages. Just download my project or clone it.
